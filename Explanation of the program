In this program we have used SWITCH statements in C.
This program gives the user a choice to choose a currency from the given options and convert it into other currencies given.
Here we have taken 4 currencies ,i.e., Dollar, Rupees, Pound and Euro.
There are 4 cases for each currency conversion. We can modify the value of currency with the actual value.
We have used operators and swtich statements to create this program. 


float - data type which is used to represent the floating point numbers. %f format specifier.
switch - A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values. 
Each value is called a case, and the variable being switched on is checked for each switch case.
syntax for swtich :
switch(expression) {

   case constant-expression  :
      statement(s);
      break; /* optional */
	
   case constant-expression  :
      statement(s);
      break; /* optional */
  
   /* you can have any number of case statements */
   default : /* Optional */
   statement(s);
}
